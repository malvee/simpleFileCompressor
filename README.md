# simpleFileCompressor
Inspired by the tv show Silicon Valley lol <br />
This only compresses text, whatever you want to compress dump it into test.txt <br /> run compress.pl which will create compressed.txt, this is the compressed file. <br /> Run uncompress.pl and it will print out the file on the terminal, re-direct the output to a fle if you want.<br />
perl compress.pl <br />
-Now you have the compressed file called compressed.txt <br />
perl uncompress.pl > mytext.txt <br />
- the uncompressed text is now in mytext.txt file
